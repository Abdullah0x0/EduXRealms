# Meow Mayhem

**Meow Mayhem** is a Mixed Reality (MR) game where players use a golden cube to strike or throw at mischievous one-eyed cat monsters. The goal is to defeat all the cats within a timed session to win the game. If the time runs out and any cats are left standing, it's game over!

1. Load the MR environment using your device.
2. Watch as the spatial area is flooded with one-eyed cat monsters and a golden cube.
3. Use the golden cube to strike or throw at the cat monsters.
4. Track your **Kill Count** on the screen as you defeat each monster.
5. Strike at least 10 cats within 20 seconds to win!
